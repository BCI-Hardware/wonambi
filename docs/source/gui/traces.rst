Jump to Epochs
==============

You can move between windows by clicking on page up and page down (to move to a completely new window) or left and right arrow (to scroll by a small amount).
You can also click on the "overview" panel at the bottom.
In addition, you can jump to specific windows, by clicking on "Go to Epoch":

You can enter the time in seconds (from the start of the recordings) or in absolute time (such as '22:30' or '22:30:10'). 
Once you select the window, the start time in the info panel is updated:
