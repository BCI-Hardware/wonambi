You can add annotations, such as sleep scoring or highlight events such as artifacts.

Import sleep scores from FASST
------------------------------

To import sleep scores from FASST, click on ``Annotations`` -> ``Import`` -> ``FASST scoring``:

.. image:: images/notes_04_import_fasst.png

First, you'll be asked to load the ``.mat`` file containing the FASST sleep scores and then you'll need to indicate where to save the annotations in ``.xml`` format.
If it's successful, the converted sleep score will appear in the ``Overview`` panel:
